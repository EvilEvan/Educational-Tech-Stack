# üéØ JOB CARD: Educational Tech Stack Repository

## üìã Project Overview

**Repository**: Educational Tech Stack Learning Materials  
**Primary Focus**: The Blazingly Fast Tech Stack (shadcn/ui + Clerk + Convex)  
**Source Video**: [The BLAZINGLY FAST Tech Stack To Build A Million Dollar App](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFWZM0saGGI) by The Coding Sloth  
**Last Updated**: August 13, 2025  
**Current Status**: ‚úÖ Major Restructuring Complete  

## üîÑ Background History & Evolution

### Original State (Pre-August 2025)
- **Scope**: Broad multi-module educational curriculum covering multiple technologies
- **Structure**: 8+ modules including Python, web dev, data science, mobile, cloud, DevOps, AI/ML, cybersecurity
- **Content**: Generic programming education with various technologies
- **Issue**: Unfocused approach, mixed content not aligned with any specific tutorial

### Transformation Request (August 13, 2025)
**User Request**: "Please optimize by adding more examples and an index"
- Added comprehensive table of contents
- Enhanced with detailed code examples
- Expanded to 441 lines with extensive documentation
- **Problem**: Became overly complex and unfocused

### Critical Pivot (August 13, 2025)
**User Directive**: "Review and keep only the data related to this video... Everything -rm everything else except if you think its detrimental and could soon have context with the video"
- **Video Focus**: The BLAZINGLY FAST Tech Stack by The Coding Sloth
- **Technologies**: shadcn/ui + Clerk + Convex specifically
- **Action**: Complete repository realignment

### Major Restructuring (August 13, 2025)
**Comprehensive Audit & Improvement Initiative**:

#### Phase 1: Content Streamlining
- **README.md**: Reduced from 441 lines to ~130 lines, laser-focused on video content
- **Removed**: All content not directly related to the video
- **Kept**: Only shadcn/ui, Clerk, and Convex materials

#### Phase 2: Advanced Exercise Addition
- **Added**: `exercises/full-stack-projects/exercise-04-pvt-class-tracker.md`
- **Based On**: Evan's PVT Class Tracker specification (provided in attachment)
- **Scope**: 6-week advanced project combining all video technologies
- **Features**: Privacy-first architecture, RBAC, mechanical rotary interface, i18n

#### Phase 3: Documentation Overhaul
- **package.json**: Updated metadata to reflect video focus
- **PROGRAM_SUMMARY.md**: Completely rewritten for video-aligned learning path
- **curriculum-overview.md**: Enhanced with clear progression and new exercise
- **AUDIT_REPORT.md**: Created comprehensive improvement documentation

## üéØ Current Repository Structure & Purpose

### Core Learning Path
```
Week 1-2: Main Tutorial (shadcn/ui + Clerk + Convex basics)
Week 3: Foundation Exercises (Python + Web fundamentals)
Week 4-9: PVT Class Tracker (Advanced full-stack application)
Week 10+: Optimization & Extensions (Expert level)
```

### Key Files & Their Purpose
- **README.md**: Entry point, video-focused quick start guide
- **modules/01-programming-fundamentals/**: Main tutorial implementation
- **exercises/python-basics/**: Programming fundamentals (3 exercises)
- **exercises/web-basics/**: Web development basics (interactive dashboard)
- **exercises/full-stack-projects/exercise-04-pvt-class-tracker.md**: Advanced 6-week project
- **PROGRAM_SUMMARY.md**: Learning progression and outcomes
- **curriculum-overview.md**: Complete curriculum structure
- **AUDIT_REPORT.md**: Detailed improvement documentation

### Technologies & Focus Areas
- **Primary Stack**: Next.js + TypeScript + shadcn/ui + Clerk + Convex
- **Advanced Features**: Framer Motion, i18n, real-time features
- **Architecture Patterns**: Privacy-first design, RBAC, component composition
- **Professional Skills**: TypeScript mastery, accessibility, performance optimization

## üß© Key Context: PVT Class Tracker Project

### Background
The advanced exercise is based on **Evan's actual PVT Class Tracker specification**, a sophisticated class management system for private tutoring operations.

### Critical Design Principles
1. **Privacy-First Architecture**: Financial data and passwords are cryptographically protected - even admin cannot access them
2. **User Empowerment**: Teachers and moderators have full control over their data
3. **Immediate Usability**: Pending approvals don't block workflow - features are usable immediately
4. **Spectacular UX**: Including mechanical rotary interface with pneumatic arms and industrial aesthetics

### Unique Features
- **Dual-password system** (user password + admin master password)
- **Complete financial data masking** from admin view
- **Privacy disclaimer system** for teachers/moderators (not admin)
- **Mechanical rotary school selector** with advanced animations
- **Multi-language support** (Thai/English - critical requirement)
- **Role-based permissions** (Teacher/Moderator/Admin with specific restrictions)

## üö® Important Constraints & Guidelines

### Content Scope
- **MUST**: Stay focused on The Coding Sloth's video content
- **MUST**: Only include shadcn/ui, Clerk, and Convex technologies
- **AVOID**: Adding unrelated technologies or generic programming content
- **EXCEPTION**: Foundation exercises (Python/Web basics) are kept for skill building

### Code Quality Standards
- **TypeScript**: All examples must use TypeScript
- **Best Practices**: Production-ready code patterns
- **Accessibility**: Include ARIA labels and proper semantics
- **Performance**: Consider optimization in all examples
- **Privacy**: Follow privacy-first architecture principles

### Documentation Style
- **Clarity**: Clear, actionable instructions
- **Progression**: Logical skill building from basic to advanced
- **Real-World Focus**: Practical, production-ready examples
- **Video Alignment**: Reference original tutorial throughout

## üéØ Future Development Guidelines

### When Adding New Content
1. **Verify Video Alignment**: Does this relate to shadcn/ui, Clerk, or Convex?
2. **Check Skill Progression**: Does this fit the beginner ‚Üí intermediate ‚Üí advanced ‚Üí expert path?
3. **Maintain Quality**: Is this production-ready, TypeScript-first code?
4. **Consider PVT Tracker**: How does this enhance the advanced project?

### When Modifying Existing Content
1. **Preserve Focus**: Keep video alignment as primary constraint
2. **Enhance, Don't Replace**: Build upon existing structure
3. **Maintain Continuity**: Ensure smooth learning progression
